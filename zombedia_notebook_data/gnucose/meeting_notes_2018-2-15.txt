After discussing with Jody

Jody suggested that we take on some trivial issues to get used to the process of contributing to an open source project whether it be a success or a learning experience.

With this in mind we took a look at the issues in https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/accessibility/ for issues that we can add to the product backlog.

We've created a new sprint titled Work on Accessibility Issues where we created an issue for creating a backlog of issues

We then added one issue and created logins for mediawiki. The logins probably need to be Developer logins for our desired functionality.

This sprint ends on Tuesday.
