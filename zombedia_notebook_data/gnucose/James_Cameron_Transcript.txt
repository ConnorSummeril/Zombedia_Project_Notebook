G'day Connor,

Nice to hear from you.  I'm in the Sydney, Australia timezone.

Sugar Labs is a community in transition after some developers left.

Sugar Labs has begun to split into three development focal points; the
Sugar desktop and apps (Python, GTK, GStreamer), the Sugarizer app
(JavaScript), and the Music Blocks app (JavaScript).

These focal points are driven by individuals; myself, Lionel Laske,
and Walter Bender.  We make the most commits and reviews.

In the past year, Sugar Labs suffered from severe public disagreements
on the mailing lists, which has led to us three concentrating more on
our tasks, and consulting less publically.  Disagreements among us
three are rare, as we have little in common in the way of goals.

(I know where you are coming from.  Among other things, I've been
firmware test engineer for OLPC, making sure system firmware, kernel
and Sugar desktop have features sufficient for manufacturing test
procedures of contract manufacturer in China.  That role has lessened,
as our latest model only needs kernel and Sugar desktop features.)

At Sugar Labs, every now and then automated tests or continuous
integration is proposed, but nothing has stuck.

I've done some scripted testing with xdotool and other tools, but this
was mainly to detect memory leaks.

We had a volunteer Daniel Narvaez who set up continuous integration
with Fedora builds on which Sugar could be installed, but Daniel
vanished without trace and the infrastructure has since rotted.

Software test infrastructure is most valuable where change is
underway; so you might evaluate the size of changes in the past few
months to the various repositories.

Disclosure statement; I'm paid by the hour for my work by OLPC Inc,
and they use the Sugar desktop in their software offering to
customers.
