0.Install the nfs kernel server:
apt install nfs-kernel-server

1. Start by going here:
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
Download the "Debian" version.

2. Find that download (.deb file) and execute to install the vagrant tool:
dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file

3. Modify your apt sources file. This file is located at /etc/apt/sources.list.
Append the following line to that file:
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free

4. Now run:
apt update && apt install virtualbox

5. Get the Vagrant OS source with the following command:
git clone --recursive https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/vagrant

6. Then go to that directory:
cd vagrant

7. Run:
./setup.sh

8. You will be prompted to sign in with Gerrit or Git, I just put in "anonymous" that's the easiest way.

9. Finally after the setup, build the virtual machine:
vagrant up

10. To install mathoid:
vagrant enable-role mathoid && vagrant provision

11. vagrant provision can hang on the following line:
Info: /Stage[main]/Mathoid/Service::Node[mathoid]/Systemd::Service[mathoid]/Service[mathoid]: Unscheduling refresh on Service[mathoid]
If that happens, hit ctrl+c twice and run "vagrant provision" again.

12. Profit
