This is the project notebook repository for Zombedia. A resurrected group
from the ashes of a Sugar Labs project. Zombedia is now working on open issues
in WikiMedia.

This repository contains all of the relevant data for our one of our final 
deliverables for the course known as "Software Engineering Practices" at the
Metropolitan State University of Denver. This course is during Spring in the
year 2018 on the Gregorian Calendar.

This repository will eventaully contain a single file which represents the 
entirety of this repository. Therefore this repository will eventually be
deprecated.
