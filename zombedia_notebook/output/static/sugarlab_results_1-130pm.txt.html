[13:00] &lt;walterbender&gt; I didn't notice the PM window
[13:00] &lt;walterbender&gt; you there?
[13:01] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Yes.
[13:02] &lt;walterbender&gt; shall we get started?
[13:02] &lt;walterbender&gt; who else is with you?
[13:02] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; I'm all set. Just me today.
[13:02] &lt;walterbender&gt; OK
[13:03] &lt;walterbender&gt; can you give me a bit more context re your project: what are the constraints?
[13:03] &lt;walterbender&gt; what is expected of your team?
[13:03] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Alright here is the class details:
[13:05] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; This project is to help with a open-source project. We are to try to do this in a Agile format, such as SCRUM. Last, we have to get this turned in by May, but ideally mid-April is a better deadline so we can finish up any documentation required.
[13:05] &lt;walterbender&gt; OK
[13:05] &lt;walterbender&gt; any prior experience with FOSS projects on the team?
[13:07] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; We worked briefly on a couple projects for BlueJ last semester. These were on build frameworks, namely ant and maven. We were also taught the basics of what we will need to work with GitHub.
[13:07] &lt;walterbender&gt; for this project, github is critical
[13:08] &lt;walterbender&gt; any one have experience with TravicCS and/or node.js?
[13:10] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Let me check some of my classmates resumes. One moment.
[13:10] &lt;walterbender&gt; don't worry about it...
[13:11] &lt;walterbender&gt; something you can learn
[13:11] &lt;walterbender&gt; Anyway, here is what I had in mind.
[13:11] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; alright.
[13:11] &lt;walterbender&gt; I have a complex project, Music Blocks, written in JavaScript and hosted on github,io
[13:12] &lt;walterbender&gt; I run TravisCS for unit tests but don't actually have any tests written.
[13:12] &lt;walterbender&gt; I am not wedded to TravisCS, but the framework is in place.
[13:13] &lt;walterbender&gt; What I'd like it for you guys to get some unit tests up and running and document the process for others to add additional tests.
[13:13] &lt;walterbender&gt; what I am most concerned with is changes that impact performance, as with music, timing is everything :P
[13:13] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Okay, so you're using it as a Continous Version System on top of GitHub? Jenkins was another one I've heard of, but that will work too.
[13:14] &lt;walterbender&gt; As I said, I am not wedded to any one system.
[13:14] &lt;walterbender&gt; A FOSS solution, of course, is preferred
[13:14] &lt;walterbender&gt; maybe the first thing you guys could do is a quick survey of what's out there?
[13:15] &lt;walterbender&gt; You may need to consider the frameworks I use: tone.js for the web audio interface and easel.js for the graphics toolkit
[13:15] &lt;walterbender&gt; everything else is pretty vanilla JS/HTML/CSS
[13:15] &lt;walterbender&gt; I try to stay away from packages as much as I can
[13:15] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; That sounds within our scope. As for the survey, we can take a look and see what's available.
[13:15] &lt;walterbender&gt; +1
[13:16] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Also, just for my understanding this music fits under Midi, or is it something else entirely?
[13:16] &lt;walterbender&gt; there are a few Sugar Labs projects using TravisCS, but I have not looked closely at the implementation
[13:16] &lt;walterbender&gt; Not MIDI
[13:16] &lt;walterbender&gt; web audio
[13:17] &lt;walterbender&gt; check out tone.js
[13:17] &lt;walterbender&gt; https://tonejs.github.io/
[13:17] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; alright.
[13:18] &lt;walterbender&gt; I do have a MIDI output mechanism through something called Lilypond, but that is not the primary use case
[13:18] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Also, do you have a current GitHub respository up in Sugar or is this still on your end?
[13:18] &lt;walterbender&gt; I will be moving the project to gh.c/sugarlabs soon, but right now, it is still under gh.c/walterbender
[13:19] &lt;walterbender&gt; It is gated on getting our new server running
[13:19] &lt;walterbender&gt; so the repo you'd be working with is https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks
[13:21] &lt;walterbender&gt; https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/ may be of use
[13:21] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Okay.
[13:22] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Do you have any other requirements you can think of at the moment that may apply?
[13:22] &lt;walterbender&gt; nope.
[13:22] &lt;walterbender&gt; just, if you do this, communication is critical
[13:23] &lt;walterbender&gt; don't get stuck down ratholes... ask questions early and often
[13:23] &lt;walterbender&gt; there are lots of knowledgeable people in the Sugar community, so leverage that
[13:24] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Alright. So what is a good time(s) to discuss with you during the week and upcoming weeks?
[13:24] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Assuming your western standard time.
[13:24] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Assuming you're western standard time.
[13:24] &lt;walterbender&gt; I'm generally around... my early mornings are busy, but that is too early for you anyway
[13:25] &lt;walterbender&gt; I am usually eating dinner around 8PM EST
[13:25] &lt;walterbender&gt; but we can always schedule something by email
[13:25] &lt;walterbender&gt; I am EST
[13:25] &lt;walterbender&gt; Boston
[13:28] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Thanks for the clarification. I'll speak it over with my group at class tonight.
[13:28] &lt;walterbender&gt; OK
[13:28] &lt;walterbender&gt; stay in touch
[13:29] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; Will do.
[13:30] &lt;LukeHopkins&gt; I'm heading off. Have a good afternoon, Walter. Thanks again.</code></pre></div>
